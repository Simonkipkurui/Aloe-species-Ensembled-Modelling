# Aloe Species Distribution Modelling in Baringo

## Description
This project focuses on modeling the distribution of Aloe species in the Baringo region using machine learning alogorithms Random forest,Gradinent boost machine and Extreme gradient boosting and environmental data. The goal is to predict the potential habitats of Aloe species based on various environmental factors such as climate, soil, and topography.

The following data sources were used in this project:
Climate Data: CHELSA
Soil Data: isric african soil grid
Topography Data:Alaska satelite facility
Species Occurrence Data: GBIF & inaturalist
Methodology
The distribution modeling was performed using the following steps:
Data Collection: Gather species occurrence data and environmental layers.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Modeling: Use a species distribution model Random forest ,Gradient boost machine , Extreme gradient boosting and Ensembled modelling  to predict habitat suitability.
Validation: Validate the model using  K- fold cross-validation and independent test data.
Visualization: Generate maps and visualizations of the predicted distributions.
